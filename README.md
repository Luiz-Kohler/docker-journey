# Docker

Docker is a platform that allows for easy and quick creation, testing, and deployment of applications. It runs applications and their necessary environment configurations in standardized units called containers. We can create multiple container instances for the same or different applications, offering benefits such as no dependency conflicts, better resource utilization, limited impact from failures, and faster startups and shutdowns. Docker is also lightweight enough for use in development environments.

## Docker Image
A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package that includes everything needed to run an applicationâ€”such as the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and dependencies. It acts as a blueprint for creating Docker containers, containing all the specifications and configurations required to instantiate and run the application consistently across any environment.

## Docker Container
A Docker container is a runtime instance of a Docker image. It provides an isolated environment where the application runs with all its required dependencies pre-installed. Containers ensure consistency across different environments, allowing the project to function exactly as intended, regardless of where it is deployed. Each container is lightweight, portable, and runs independently, making it ideal for developing, testing, and deploying applications efficiently.

The [course](https://courses.devopsdirective.com/docker-beginner-to-pro/lessons/00-introduction/01-main) where I obtained the most of information. It's definitely one of the best I've seen on the topic.
